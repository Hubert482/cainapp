# CAINAPP 2 BETAüöß

Welcome to CAINAPP 2.0!

### What is CAIN?

##### CAIN - Channel Attention Is All You Need for Video Frame Interpolation

CAIN is a very fast interpolation network that doesn't use much vram (Ex: 5GB with fp16 for 8k)! 



### What is cainapp?

##### 

Cainapp is a gui for cain with some new things like fp16, saving frames on other threads and more! Look at the code!

## What are the requirements?

Unlike previously, Cainapp now runs on CUDA. Fortunately, it runs on the driver-based version, so the only requirements are

1. A nvidia GPU
2. Driver version >396.26

So in theory, it could even run on a GTX 650



## How to install üíæ

1. Download python 3.9 üì• (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2-amd64.exe)

2. Install python 3.9, and remember to select "Add to PATH"

3. In cmd run 

   `pip install pyqt5`

   `pip install qdarkstyle`

   `pip install torch==1.8.1+cu111 torchvision==0.9.1+cu111 torchaudio===0.8.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html` this can need much time ‚åö

   `pip install tqdm`

   for windows:

   `pip install opencv-python`

   for linux:

   `pip install opencv-python-headless`

   

4. Download ffmpeg üì• (https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z) 

5. Extract üì¶ ffmpeg.exe in cainapp folderüìÅ

6. Download the model, rename it to stable.pth, and put it into the cain folderüìÅ

7. In cmd, run ` cd path/to/cainapp/ ` then ```python main.py```

## How to run the discord botü§ñ

Basically the same as in How to install but you need to install 2 more things

`pip install discord.py` 

`pip install requests`

And put your token to token.txt 

And run ```python 1.py```

Sadly, Discord limits the file size to 8MB, so bitrate isn't high and video length is limited. Audio is also only 69kbps

As a note to windows users, python 3.9 only supports Windows 8+, so don't expect it to work with 7, if you were even planning on using that in the first place.
